Riara School of International Relations and Diplomacy 
Welcome message from the Dean.
I would like to welcome you to the exciting School of International Relations and Diplomacy at Riara University. Through its various programs, the school offers a unique blend of academic and professional development to enable students to become future leaders and employable graduates. We recognize that in the current era of global interdependence, collaborative efforts are needed to meet the most pressing challenges in the international system. 
The global emerging labour markets are in need of graduates with innovative and critical mind set, global thinkers, entrepreneurial acumen, and most recently, system thinkers, to take the world of work to the next level. To achieve this, the program critically analyzes key areas of International Relations, such as, Diplomacy, Foreign Policy, International Law, Conflictological Studies, International Security, and International Political Economy through a multidisciplinary approach. Our first-rate students are continuously exposed to practical leadership skills through diverse expositions, such as, ‘simulation’, ‘pitching’, and structured ‘diplomatic clinics.’ Besides, the cutting-edge faculty, enthusiastic support staff, we have a vibrant seminar series at the center of our post-graduate programmes. We pride of an international academic advisory team, born out of our global rich networking social capitals such as eminent scholarship, sustained scientific research and leadership in the ‘system thinking’ pedagogical practice.
About School
 Philosophy of the School
Just like a river flows from the source to the next larger water body, the education process in various fields of study is endless. The field of International Relations and Diplomacy (IRD) is not an exemption. The discipline is as old as humanity with its formation drawing from some of the remarkable global human events, such as, wars and conflicts. It therefore, forms a self-reinforcing educational system, forming an ecosystem of students, faculty, stakeholders and members of the public, in a mutual web of co-existence. As a teaching and research faculty, the school of IRD recognizes the changing global environment. In the recent past, there has been a growing criticism of the two extreme schools of thought governing the field of International Relations- realism and liberalism. Seemingly, the centralist viewpoint is holding grip and continuous to influence the current and future scholarship and policy in IR. Hence, the school of IRD believes that the notion, ‘three-legged middle-ground’, forms a plausible body of knowledge worth scholarly interrogation.
This viewpoint is anchored on the idea that, ‘regional integration (with reference to Africa and the entire global south), is a function of international politics, and that states seek to establish order in the international system by building stronger regional bodies from below.’ In this sense, states at the regional level form an ‘integrated system’, where a type of order does exist, based on shared localities, cultural norms, geographical proximity, technological/infrastructural shareability, economic and social interactivities and behaviours. As such, our graduates are instrumental in advancing the ‘three-legged middle ground’ thinking by being alive to the fact that, solving issues affecting the international system cannot be complete without incorporating the cultures, norms and realities from the global south. At the same time, global peace cannot be achieved by denouncing intercultural interdependence. With this conscious understanding of the inseparability of the international system, graduates from the school of IRD, attain knowledge, skills and competencies, that enable them to contribute to their ability to become more committed to the global peace for sustainable development. And by so doing, they acquire the mind set and capability needed to make appropriate moral and intellectual choices and decisions that will affect, not only their immediate surrounding, but the entire global system.
Goals of the School
	•	Examine the contending views and emerging challenges in all the dimensions of the international system.
	•	Explain the history, evolution and theories of International Relations as a field of study.
	•	Evaluate the foreign policy and diplomatic practice of different states and how they influence international relations.
	•	Assess the benefits of international rule of law in the conduct of contemporary IR.
	•	Examine contemporary challenges in the international and regional system and suggest tools for solving them.
	•	Identify emerging challenges of IR in the 21st Century.
In this way the programme shall achieve its ultimate goal of producing innovative and skilled diplomats, scholars, policy makers and administrators who can serve effectively in government institutions, Inter-governmental Agencies, Non-governmental Organizations, International Institutions and other relevant organizations. Concurrently, the programme also focuses on providing a holistic education that equips learners with the capacity to realize their individual full potential and to develop social and moral values which guide their actions through life.
Expected Learning Outcomes
	•	Design problem solving approaches for emerging problems in the international/regional system.
	•	Apply the theories of IR in analyzing contemporary problems and challenges in the international/regional system.
	•	Identify and apply the relevant tools of diplomacy in the conduct of the foreign policy and diplomacy of their countries.

About The Dean
Prof. Francis Onditi is associate professor of Confictology &amp; Head of Department (HoD), School of International Relations and Diplomacy, Riara University, Nairobi, Kenya. An authority on the geography of African conflicts and their evolutionary nature, he is a distinguished research professor at the Institute for Intelligent Systems (IIS), University of Johannesburg, and was awarded the 2019 AISA Fellowship by South Africa’s Human Sciences Research Council (HSRC). 

He was recently ranked among the World’s Top 2% scientists/researchers of the year 2022/2023/2024 listed by the Stanford University, USA. Having authored and edited 7 major volumes (books), and over 100 articles and book chapters, in 2023, he was awarded the Erasmus Mundus Global teaching fellowship at Leipzig University, Germany. Prof. Onditi’s research contribution is mainly in modeling, thinking uncharted models, and development of theoretical frameworks and concepts, including the ‘dominatarian theory of regional integration’, and ‘Technology for Peaceful Society’ (T4PS). 
His current professorial research focuses on “exploring the analytical conception of the closeness centrality, and its implications for a theory of interactivities for enhancing understanding of the process of conflict excavators and extractives with the aim of providing an explanation of the intrinsic character of interaction among human beings, communities, and states as a process of diffusion of power, conflict reversals, and peace interlocutors.” He founded the idea of ‘interethnic border markets’ and is the Principal Investigator (PI) for his Conflictology lab- Centre for Conflictological Observatory and Predictive Studies (CCOPS), in which, the quest is to understand how the interethnic market spaces can be developed into Infrastructures for Peace (I4P), in order to make communities more resilient to conflict vectors (What is the likelihood of conflict, when people, states, or societies are close to each other or far apart?) 
He held a Graduate Research Assistant position at IDS, and thereafter completing his MA degree he taught courses in Geography, both at the University of Nairobi. Prior to joining Riara University, Onditi spent some years working with United Nations agencies and International Peace Support Training Centre (IPSTC). In both institutions, he served in different capacities, including, Ag. Head of Research Department, Directing Staff (DS), Analyst and advisor on women, peace, and security (WPS). Onditi is a recipient of a number of awards including, the best MA grands by IFRA/C.R.E.AT.I.N.G /EU, and the AAU post-graduate scholarship. His 700-page Doctoral Research Dissertation was recognized as a pioneer piece in enriching peace and conflict studies with PSO concepts. A Pan-African scholar and conflict researcher, Prof. Onditi received his Bachelors and MA degrees from the University of Nairobi, under the scholarship scheme, and PhD. at MMUST. 

He is also trained in Strategic Management, Innovation, and Leadership at MCTC-MASHAV, Haifa, Israel.

Research
Francis Onditi Conflictology Lab
About Us
Conflict Observatory & Prediction (COP) Group/Lab conducts scientific research in conflictological studies; the causes, and their occurrence, mechanisms, forecasting of conflict & wars, polemology (war studies), modeling of conflict and resolution scenarios, and patterns of conflict development/evolution.
We study both international and non-international conflicts (NIAC). Our lab comprises scholars, researchers, scientists, political scientists, and international relations researchers committed to addressing the challenges of conflict using distinct methodological approaches to analytical performance (quantitative) and integrative qualitative analytics.
What We Study?
In our Conflictology group/lab, we are interested in studying closeness centrality between individuals, groups or states and how this process leads to evolution of conflict and/or resolution thereof. We believe conflict evolves through salient structures such as markets and pastoral transhumance spaces. We therefore, study space and networks in intertribal border markets as factories of conflict and infrastructure for peace. How is conflict produced in intergroup interaction or within those networks in space and time? How does space between individuals, groups or states influence prevalence of conflict? How does distance and social geometry influence conflict formation? How are conflict vibes and triggers distributed in space and time? How does individuals, groups or state’s spatial representation affect conflict evolution, resolution and transformation? Our approach is conflictological- progressing from states to the underlying interaction between individuals and within groups in space and time.
Our research is focused on two spaces: (1) The intertribal border markets- to mean both tangible and intangible expression to principles of social structure binding communities to a holistic system through human relations in time and space. We consider a ‘market’ to represent both spatial space and a set of norms, institutions and value system upon which individuals, groups or states transact conflict and peace. (2) Transhumance Pastoralism- this form of livelihood has shifted from community-based herding to market-centered. Climate change continues to shrink the grazing land, consequently, disrupting livelihood. This environmental change has led to the evolution of maladaptive strategies such as armament of pastoral communities with small arms and light weapons (SALW). Proliferation of SALW is the major cause of death and disrupted livelihood among pastoral communities.
We believe that some of the most challenging questions in conflictology and polemology (war studies) today, can be answered by studying states, individuals and groups as a whole unit through interdisciplinary prism. For example, the important question of how non-state actors such as the extremist groups shapes the domestic and international security architecture of states has been studied extensively in Africa and other parts of the globe. As a result of this research, the African Peace and Security Council and the United Nations Security Council offers the opportunity to extremist groups to the negotiating table.
In our lab, we are expanding this research on the actors of conflict to address a broad scope of actors (state, individual and group) as a whole unit related to production, distribution and transformation of conflict. The interdisciplinary work in our lab hosts collaborations between conflictologists, geographers, mathematicians, climate change scientists, GIS experts, economists and international relations researchers, all under one umbrella of Conflictology. We strive to understand the human-human relations/networks that drives human behaviour and dictates their actions in groups and at states level in time and space.

PROJECTS & FIELDWORK
Transhumance Pastoralism Conflict Study
One of the most basic characteristics of conflict is its ability to change as the macro-environment changes. In my lab, we are interested to decipher the structural and systemic mechanisms responsible for long term changes in pastoral transhumance. These changes can give us insight on the capacity of pastoral communities to change, adapt or maladapt to environmental changes.
Transhumance Pastoralism- this form of livelihood has shifted from community-based herding to market-centered. Climate change continues to shrink the grazing land, consequently, disrupting livelihood. This environmental change has led to the evolution of maladaptive strategies such as armament of pastoral communities with small arms and light weapons (SALW). Proliferation of SALW is the major cause of death and disrupted livelihood among pastoral communities.
In the lab, we study how pastoral transhumance has shifted over time and space in response to environmental changes. We study a diverse context, adaptation and maladaptation of pastoralists as our main hypothesis is that the various adaptation and maladaptation strategies leads to various intercommunal relational problems thus mechanism for resolving them may differ markedly between different geographical regions. We use geographical techniques and economic modelling combined to discover patterns of conflict occurrence and evolution in various Clusters.
Currently, we are focusing on the Karamoja Cluster since it is an extremely important when it comes to proliferation of small arms and light weapons (SALW).
Understanding the mechanisms underlying kinship relations among pastoral communities may assist in understanding the mechanics of armament and in turn may assist in developing novel disbarment and livelihood strategies.
Intertribal Border Market Study
The intertribal border markets- to mean both tangible and intangible expression to principles of social structure binding communities to a holistic system through human relations in time and space. We consider a ‘market’ to represent both spatial space and a set of norms, institutions and value system upon which individuals, groups or states transact conflict and peace. We believe the dynamics intertribal markets reflects the societal set up. Unlike the family unit of the society which is a simple functional unit, the market is a complex representation of the society. It is complex both structurally and functionally. In my lab, we seek to understand how individuals, groups or therefore states in different space and time integrate or disintegrate from each other.
For this purpose, we study and measure closeness centrality, which is the basic structure of relationship. Closeness centrality can be regarded as the network powerhouse of the society or state and thus are crucial for understanding how strong or weak closeness between states, individual or group is and ultimately encoding and decoding of conflict scenarios. One of the issues my lab is focusing on is to determine the role of closeness centrality in evolution of conflict- both ethnic and interstate. This approach is unique in that it interrogates the ‘collectivist theorem’ against the novel quasi-experimental techniques to make determination as to whether collectivism leads to peace or not and therefore how individualist theorem offers alternative explanation.
We use diverse methods- quasi-experiments, computer modelling and observational techniques to get insight into these complex, intricate intertribal market structures and functions.
We believe that understating how intertribal markets work is essential for understanding and predicting how conflict occurs, patterns, and how it can be resolved in time and space. 

Riara School of Communication and Multimedia Journalism 
Welcome message from the Dean

Effective communication is a vital backbone to societal advancement.
In recognition to this, the Communication and Multimedia Journalism Department endeavours to train a great communicator who has command over language and medium; whose cache is full of the soft skills of persuasion and negotiation; whose psychological make up breaks down messages to the audiences level; and whose perspective and ideology is global as this will spur development.
Our department trains hard-working and innovative journalists who can hit the ground running as soon as they get into the job market. During their studies here, we send them into the real world to write and record about real people in real situations. Further, we consistently strive to create industry ready professionals by engaging key stakeholders in our classrooms where they share their experiences and pass on knowledge to the learners. A key component of our programme is that most units are practical oriented exposing our learners to studio settings of media production that prove quite engaging to our learners.
Another key differentiator is that learners must develop their own impressive portfolio of still photos, video clips and different print media stories that they can showcase to prospective employers and hence gaining an added advantage compared to their peers.
Lastly, as faculty, our actions are guided by our scholarship and expertise in this area. We make it our goal to guide your development and to allow you to achieve your personal best as budding communication scholars and practitioners. We present to you the core underpinnings of our exciting and innovative modern discipline, in the hope that you will be equally intrigued, engaged and inspired by how the field has developed over time from using smoke signals to using 140 characters to tell a whole story. We trust that as we engage, your taste and zest for learning, which is truly what an education is all about, will be inspired.
Welcome to Riara University. Welcome to Communication and Multimedia Journalism Department.
About School

Philosophy of the Programme
The philosophy guiding this programme is founded on the conviction, belief and appreciation that the acquisition of knowledge must take cognizance of the ever changing media environment and tech-savvy era in order to produce graduates who can effectively address media issues and create content for the digital era in Kenya, Africa and the world. It is the conviction of Riara University (RU) that every person deserves information and this information can only be communicated effectively by adequately trained media practitioners. To achieve this goal, RU believes in nurturing professionally competent journalists who are ethical, morally and spiritually upright, of high integrity, dependable, committed, role models, critical and responsive to the fast changing society. RU believes that these professionally trained journalists will contribute positively by giving members of the public credible, accurate and timely information and by extension transform lives the people at the County, National, Regional and International levels. This programme is thus anchored on a practical orientation. It embraces the challenges which are faced by contemporary journalism where a journalist is today required to be part writer, photographer, video maker, and sound expert as well as being able to edit and assemble media in an online multimedia platform.  The degree prepares graduates to become professional graduates for the digital platform as well as equip them with skills and competencies needed to work and excel in this rapidly changing field.
Rationale of the Programme
The advent of the information age has made communication an integral part of people’s lives. In Kenya, the advent of media liberalization in the 1990s leading to opening up of traditional media space has been followed by an unprecedented growth of radio and television as well as the expansion of the print media. The media continues to play important roles in education, informing and entertaining the population. The growth of multiple languages of broadcasting and the new media platforms has brought with it attendant opportunities and challenges. As an academic and practical field, understanding the media is central to the future development of the industry. Moreover, the role of journalism and communication in development cannot be gainsaid. In order to address different issues that confront Kenyan and African population in general, the mass and new media plays an important role. Communication intervention through both mediated communication and carefully designed programs have helped to promote not only societal change but also behavior change.
The growth of new technologies including mobile telephony, digital platforms, social media and the internet has greatly altered information delivery. Using a combination of satellite, internet and cellular technologies, mass media content can now be delivered using computers and cell phones which can be accessed through social media sites such as Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, and Netflix among others. These opportunities have allowed people to exchange information in critical areas of development such as financial exchange, health, education, environment, among others altering people’s lives in different ways. Furthermore, the developments noted above have been central to the opening up of the global space leading to participation of world population in different endeavours uninhibited by spatial considerations. The program provides students with an avenue to acquire and use skills and knowledge to be able to package content for the digital media environment in Kenya and beyond. Students will learn to report and create compelling content that is of human interest in politics, economy, educational science, health and environment, sports and entertainment. 
The programme draws from the UNESCO 2013 model for journalism training and education. The model envisions journalism education and training as a constantly changing practice of a particular type of communication in the public interest. This model is premised on two trajectories with regards to journalism education. Firstly  it recognizes that journalism training has evolved  and secondly that there is need to renegotiate the future of journalism education in the world taking into account the increasingly complex social, technological, political and economic context that journalism operates. In this regard, this programme responds to the national need for human capacity development in the area of new media and multimedia journalism.

Teachers aspiring to develop their career prospects will find the Standards a helpful guide to define areas for their professional development. The Standards provide a common language and framework of expectations that will help the whole community within a school to reflect on the effectiveness of its teaching and leadership. We recognize that classroom teaching has a substantial impact on the quality of educational outcomes (Rowe et al, 2012, Sanders & Rivers, 1996, Wiliam, 2018). It is what teachers know and do that makes the difference in improving student learning outcomes – their knowledge, pedagogical practices and relationships with students (Coe et al, 2014, Hattie 2009). We also recognize that teachers cannot sustain high-quality outcomes for all students without effective leadership (Menter et al, 2010, Rowe et al 2012). The Standards are designed to be applicable internationally, so they do not refer to specific curricula, teaching strategies or programmes. Instead, the seven Standards draw on international best practice in teaching and leadership at a generic level. As the Standards are provided as a resource for ongoing teacher and leader improvement, rather than accountability (OECD 2009), a single level is provided for each Standard. They focus on supporting all aspects of a leader’s or teacher’s professional learning and development, recognizing the demands and complexity of their role and the dynamic reforms in education globally.

Mentorship Programme
Riara University Mentoring Programme
At Riara University, while pursuing a rigorous academic programme, we also provide the student with mentoring services. We assign experienced persons (mentors) to walk with the student part of the way in order to enhance the student’s personal, academic and career prospects.
The Riara University Mentoring Programme (RUMP) is coordinated by the Office of the Dean of Students. Through this programme, Riara University students will be exposed to support, guidance, friendship, role modelling, assistance, and an attentive ear. In addition, the programme will ensure that informal, or non-structured mentoring takes place in all types of student programmes and services at Riara University.
The Riara University Mentoring Programme will be structured as follows:
Student peer mentoring
In this case, each first year student participating in the programme will be matched with a peer mentor from a senior class based on similar academic and social backgrounds. Through this programme, new students will easily acclimatize to university life, get opportunities to have a successful first year and access support in academic and social activities.
Lecturer-student mentoring
Lecturers will be identified and involved in the programme to assist students who may be facing emotional and social challenges that may inhibit the realization of their full potential in academic and personal areas.
Professional peer tutoring
The programme will similarly match experienced professionals with young and upcoming professionals to support their professional and personal growth.
Academic Support
As part of the student mentoring package, Riara University offers student academic workshops and individual consultations to support undergraduates as they transition from student to scholar. Students learn how to manage large reading loads, get the most out of course texts, take effective notes and create study tools, manage time, and overcome test anxiety or procrastination, among others.
Community Service

Community Service
Community involvement is the cornerstone of the Riara University Education philosophy.  Each year many high school students enter institutions of higher learning to gain skills that will enable them earn an income either as entrepreneurs or through employment. Majority may not realize that the skills gained have a direct impact on the society in which they live and that the training gained is not only beneficial to them but also to the society at large. The community service program is tailored to combine reflective learning with service towards a common good.  The coordination office is established to ensure that the programs chosen and the service given by students are of high quality and sustainable over a long period of time. Service combined with learning adds value to each and transforms both (Honnet and Poulsen, 1989).
In order to quality for graduation, students are required to take a minimum of 100hours engaging in community based attachment where they are expected to offer their time and effort to improve the community. This unpaid work may be undertaken in children’s homes, orphanages, hospitals, disadvantaged schools, slums, prisons, juvenile courts, remand schools, Small and Medium Enterprises (SME’s) etc. Such work may include legal aid, basic Information Communication Technology (ICT) services or any other charitable work as may be required.
The objectives of the program are:

	•	To mold students to become responsible and provide patriotic citizens who are mindful of others in the society.
	•	To develop positive vision, values and attitudes in students that will lead to positive character formation and transformation of society.
	•	To enable students and the university to give back to the society as part of the University’s corporate social responsibility.
	•	To establish networks with charitable, legal aid (LLB students) and other organizations as a foundation for job placement with Non-Governmental Organizations (NGOs), humanitarian and other institutions.
	•	To equip students with the skills necessary for responding to development challenges and problems.
	•	To enable students to experience and be exposed to realities of life.

Guiding Mantra
Quality Education is the solid bedrock for National Development

About Riara University
The Riara Story

The Riara Group of Schools was founded by Mr. Daniel and Prof. Eddah Gachukia in 1974 as a commitment to the development of a whole learner. The education concept at Riara is one that goes beyond the conventional classroom and syllabus-based learning.
The process of developing education flows like the perennial Riara River which is forever challenging, forever nourishing, forever fulfilling. This has seen the Riara Group of schools grow from Kindergarten level, then to Primary School, proceeded to Secondary level and now to University and International School levels. Each level of growth of the Riara experience has then become a fountain that has sprung from fertile ground, showering all those it reaches who in turn impact others with enthusiasm, courage and God given brilliance that has continually been embodied by the ever-flowing Riara River.

“Quality Education is the solid bedrock for National Development”
Guided by the vision of this mantra, the founders of Riara established first the Riara Group of Schools 40 years ago and then the Riara University 6 years ago. Today, we have young Kenyans who came to; Riara Kindergarten then went to; the Riara Primary School and later went to; the Riara Secondary School and today they are at; the Riara University.
